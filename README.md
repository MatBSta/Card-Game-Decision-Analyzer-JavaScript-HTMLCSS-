# Card-Game-Decision-Analyzer-JavaScript-HTMLCSS-
Web application serves as a decision analysis tool for a OKEY card game. It allows users to simulate card setups and evaluate possible actions based on the Expected Value of hand strength. The app applies concepts from decision tree analysis — each card combination represents a decision branch with assigned expected value and associated risk.

The system calculates expected value using probabilities of card outcomes and their potential payoffs. Built-in risk analysis tools help compare strategies with different variances and select the optimal decision according to the player’s risk attitude (risk-averse or risk-seeking).

The interface is built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, featuring dynamic card highlighting (green, red, white) depending on hand evaluation. The app runs entirely client-side, enabling instant simulation of strategies without server interaction.

This project demonstrates practical use of expected value, risk/reward ratio, and decision trees in a gaming context — blending decision theory with risk management principles.
